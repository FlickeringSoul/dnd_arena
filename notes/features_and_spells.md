The line between some spells and feature
is thin.

The divine smite feature of paladin
allow to spend spell slot to increase
the damage of your hit

The absorb element spell allow you
to spend a spell slot and your reaction
to resit the damage your about to take

The duelist feat allows you to use
your reaction to add your proficiency
bonus to your AC for an attack

---

We could separate spells. The actions ones
from the reactions spells
